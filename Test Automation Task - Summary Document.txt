Python Script Summary document:

This document will help to provide an overview on the Test Automation script written in Selenium & Python using Pycharm Editor. 

The 8 steps to be automated were as follows: 

1. Open site https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/
2. Add to cart 4 - Gwyn Endurance Tee Medium Green
3. Address should United Kingdom
4. Check cart total is $92.00 (discount applied)
5. Update the Quantity of  Gwyn Endurance Tee Medium Green to 3
6. Add to cart 1 - Gwyn Endurance Tee Small Yellow
7. Add to cart 1 Quest Lumaflexâ„¢ Band
8. Check cart total is $116.00

To automate the above 8 steps, below approach was followed:

- Import the required Python libraries & Selenium web drivers
- 3 function definitions were utilized namely:
	1. selectProduct - helps in searching the item from the search bar and select the specified item's color, size and quantity
	2. CheckOut - helps to open and view the cart items summary
	3. validateTotal - helps to compare the expected total amount with the actual cart total amount

- The forementioned functions were called throughout the script to achieve/validate the desired output
- The output observed with the script were as follows:
	1. The Cart Total of $92.00  is successful at step #4
	2. The Cart Total of $116.00  is not successful at step #8

The Cart Totals have been duly printed with necessary print statements in validateTotal() function calls. Lastly, it was observed that the webpage takes certain 
amount of time to load and the same is accomodated into the script via Sleep/Wait() statements
 
Observation:
After following the sequence of Step 1-7; the cart total observed was $115; which was different from the expected value of $116 (in Step 8). So, the validation 
check was done accordingly.
